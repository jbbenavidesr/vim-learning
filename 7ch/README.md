# Personalizing vim

Vim comes with a very minimal configuration that allows one to set things up as needed.

It is very customizable. At first I should not lose much time in this part, however some important notes:

- in general configuration goes in the `.vimrc` file in the home directory.
- You can change color, config, status, add number lines, etc.
- You can have a local `vimrc` for each project.
