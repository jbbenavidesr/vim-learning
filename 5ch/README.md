# Vim Concepts

This is a simple chapter that introduces some important concepts of working with vim.

## Modes

One of the special things about vim is that it has some modes and it works different in each. The most important ones are:

- **Normal mode:** The most common one used for navigation and text editing. Most of time should be spent here.
- **Insert mode:** This one is for inserting text. Just use for typing.
- **Visual mode:** For selecting text. commands apply to the selected text. Most times it is unnecessary and the command can be applied directly, useful when visual hint is necessary.
- **Insert Normal mode:** When in insert mode you need to enter a normal mode command `ctrl-o` enters you to this mode for entering the command and automatically returning to Insert mode.

## Commands

The most important concept is commands because they are what you do all the time. There are different commands in the different modes.
