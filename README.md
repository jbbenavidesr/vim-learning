# Hello world from vim!

This folder will be where I work my way through learning how to use vim as text editor.

I'm following the book "Mastering Vim Quickly: from WTF to OMG in no time"

Up to chapter 4, the book is basically introductions and installation guides.

Here's a small recap:

- Chapter 1 was a preface about the book.
- Chapter 2 was an introduction to Vim, and to some learning techniques.
- Chapter 3 was an installation guide and a talk about vim's editing philosophy.

In the rest of the book I'll go taking notes in this folder in order to practice Vim
by using it. The format is going to be in a folder for every chapter with a README that
contains the notes and if there's any additional exercise in the chapter, then the corresponding
files go there too.
