# My first Vim session

In this chapter it actually starts with the vim guide.
The main idea is to learn how to open a file with vim by typing `vim` in the command line.

Once in the editor it's important to have in mind that vim is modal, then you appear in Normal mode
by default and to enter text you type `i` to change to insert mode. Then with `Esc` you go back to normal mode.

In normal mode, commands start with `:`. For example, to save the file you type `:wq <filename>` where `w`
is for write and `q` for quit. 

To open Vim in an specific file type `vim <filename>` and to close a file without saving type `:q!`
